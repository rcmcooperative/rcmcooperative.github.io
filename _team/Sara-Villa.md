Sara is a researcher with more than 10 years of experience in experimental and computational resarch in healthcare (cancer and neuroscience genomics). She is a natural problem solver, and thrives working collaboratively and including different disciplines and actors into her and other’s research.
Sara’s collaborative nature has led her to work as a Community manager for different scientific communities, like [The Turing Way](http://book.the-turing-way.org/) (shere she is part of the Community Management Working Group), [DSxHE](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com) and [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org). Her love for continuous improvement drives her training work, where she is working on bringing open science skills to diverse actors and projects.
